## Here are some rules:

Puzzle: There are 6 persons (GINA, KEN, LISA, TOM, CINDY and OMAN) who want to cross a bridge at night.

    GINA takes 1 second to cross the bridge.
    KEN takes 2 seconds to cross the bridge.
    LISA takes 4 seconds to cross the bridge.
    TOM takes 6 seconds to cross the bridge.
    CINDY takes 8 seconds to cross the bridge.
    OMAN takes 12 seconds to cross the bridge.

There is only one torch with them and the bridge cannot be crossed without the torch. There cannot be more than two persons on the bridge at any time, and when two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower personâ€™s pace.

Can they all cross the bridge in 30 seconds?
